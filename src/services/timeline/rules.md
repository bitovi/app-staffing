## Rules

1. A unit of time may not be displayed in partial. A displayed month always represents all the weeks in it, a displayed quarter always represents all the months in it, etc.

2. A week begins on Monday and ends on Sunday.

3. A week belongs to the month, quarter, and year that matches its earliest middle workday. (For a week starting on Monday, that would be Wednesday. The effect of this is that it belongs to the month with the most days in that week.)

4. Always show at least three weeks. If the last week being displayed breaks into the next month, then show the entire month broken down into weeks.

5. Always show at least two full months that aren't broken down. If the last month being displayed breaks into the next quarter, then show the entire quarter broken down into months.

6. Always show at least one full quarter that is not broken down.

7. Always show at least 6 months total. Additional quarters may be needed to complete the display.
